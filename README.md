## Short Notes on Vercel v0 Usage

Some components in this project were built using Vercel v0, a tool for rapid UI prototyping. Specifically:
- The pricing card component was generated using v0 for quick design iteration.
- Other parts of the application were custom-built to ensure full control and customization.
- Using v0 helped balance rapid design iteration with custom, hand-crafted components, resulting in a clean and professional landing page.
